# Guessing-Game
This is a simple guessing game implemented in Java. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. After each guess, the program tells the user whether their guess was too high or too low. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program tells them how many guesses it took and ends the game.
